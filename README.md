## 📖 How It Works

1. Clone the repository to your local environment:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   ```bash
   npm install  
   cd client && npm install  
   ```
3. Run the development servers:
   ```bash
   npm run dev  
   cd client && npm start  
   ```
4. Access the platform in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
